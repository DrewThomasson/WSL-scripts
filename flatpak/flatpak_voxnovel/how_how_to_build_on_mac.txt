# In order to bash into the existing docker image cause youve already built it run this command:


docker build --platform linux/amd64 -it flatpak-builder-image .


docker run -it flatpak-builder-image bash



#The whole point of this is to try building VoxNovel in a flatpak to make it easier to put on
# other linux Distros with a simple apt-get install or something like that
